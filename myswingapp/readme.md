_1. Main: we place the main class to be able to run the app.
_2. Communication: the class that handles the connection with the api.
_3. Mappers: the files needed to map all the information we need to obtain and display.
_4. Screens: the classes with the design and logic of the screens.

On the other side we have another folder where we have the AppTest.java, with the unit tests done.
